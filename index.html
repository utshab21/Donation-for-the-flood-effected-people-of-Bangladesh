        <small>There are now some 3.5 million victims of flooding in Bangladesh. Of the 64 districts in Bangladesh, 30 are flooded directly or indirectly.Continuous heavy rainfall and water from the Meghalay hills in India have caused the flash floods. The water current is flowing above danger level in most of the main rivers in the country.Most of the bordering districts in the north and northwest Bangladesh have also been affected.Thousands of people have taken shelter in the high embankments, which are also cracked at different points.Also many have taken shelter in thatched and corrugated iron sheet rooftops, local schools, other people's houses, or high land under the open sky.In different flood affected places diarrhea and pneumonia have broken out. Immediate needs of the victims are food, medicine and shelter.
